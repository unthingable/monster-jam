Considered features besides the obvious.

* CONTROL: browse device bank with group buttons
* (done) PERFORM-style controls
* Quick device recall with MACRO
* BW4 fill (with NOTE REPEAT)
* Hide debug output

More challenging but also interesting:

* Maschine-style scenes
* Parameter locks
* Parameter snapshots with crossfade
